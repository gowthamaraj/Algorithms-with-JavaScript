# Algorithms with Javascript
>Time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. Similarly, Space complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of space or memory taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input.

`Hence, we use methods to make a trade-off between them`

## Some sorting Algorithm
    00.insertionSort.js
    00.quickSort.js
## Optimization with Caching
    01.uniqueSort.js  - Removes the reapeating values and sort the unique values.
    02.memoization.js - Memoization - caching a value that a function returns.
    03.memoizationClosure - with the concept of closure to remove the global variable.
    04.memoizationGeneric - pass a function as am argument to the main function.
## Recursion
    05.factorialWithMemoization - using recursion
## Divide and Conquer
    06.linearSearch.js
    07.binarySearch.js
    08.bubbleSort.js
    09.mergeSort.js
